`python-kacl` and it `kacl-cli` can be installed either

- from source
- via the pip package `python-kacl`
- docker

All approaches are described in detail within this section.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mschmieder/python-kacl
cd python-kacl

  Example:

      kacl-cli release 1.0.0

      kacl-cli release major|minor|patch

  -m, --modify            This option will add the changes directly into
                          changelog file.
  -l, --link TEXT         A url that the version will be linked with.
  -g, --auto-link         Will automatically create and update necessary
                          links.
  -c, --commit            If passed this will create a git commit with the
                          changed Changelog.
  --commit-message TEXT   The commit message to use when using --commit flag
  -t, --tag               If passed this will create a git tag for the newly
                          released version.
  --tag-name TEXT         The tag name to use when using --tag flag
  --tag-description TEXT  The tag description text to use when using --tag
                          flag
  -d, --allow-dirty       If passed this will allow to commit/tag even on a
                          "dirty".
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

**Git Support**

`kacl-cli` provides a direct integration into your git repository. When releasing you often want to directly commit and tag the changes you did.
Using the `release` command you can simply add the `--commit/--tag` option(s) that will add the changes made by the tool to git. These flags only take effect if you also provide
the `--modify` option, otherwise no change will happen to your file system. By specifying `--commit-message` and `--tag-description` you can also decide what kind of information you
want to see within the commit. Have a look at the _config_ section that shows more options to use along with the `release` command.

**Messages (--commit-message, --tag-name, --tag-description)**

This is templated using the Python Format String Syntax. Available in the template context are `latest_version` and `new_version` as well as all `environment variables` (prefixed with \$).
You can also use the variables `now` or `utcnow` to get a current timestamp. Both accept datetime formatting (when used like as in `{now:%d.%m.%Y}`).
Also available as --message (e.g.: kacl-cli release patch --commit --commit--message '[{now:%Y-%m-%d}] Jenkins Build {$BUILD_NUMBER}: {new_version}')

**Auto Link Generation**

`kacl-cli` can automatically generate links for every version for you. Using the `--auto-link` option will generate _version comparison_ links for you. The link generation can be configured using the _config_ file. See the config section for more details

```bash
kacl-cli release 1.0.0 --auto-link
```

## Link Generation

`kacl-cli` let's you easily generate links to your versions. You can automatically generate all links following the desired patterns using `kacl-cli link generate`.
The link generation can also be easily included into the `release` command and will take care of updating the `unreleased` and `latest_version` section.

```bash
Usage: kacl-cli link generate [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -m, --modify                    This option will add the changes directly
                                  into changelog file.
  --host-url TEXT                 Host url to the git service. (i.e
                                  https://github.com/mschmieder/python-kacl)
  --compare-versions-template TEXT
                                  Template string for version comparison link.
  --unreleased-changes-template TEXT
                                  Template string for unreleased changes link.
  --initial-version-template TEXT
                                  Template string for initial version link.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

**Url Templating**

in order to generate the correct urls, `python-kacl` allows you to define three templates `compare-versions-template`, `unreleased-changes-template` and `initial-version-template` that can be used to tell the system how to generate proper links. The easiest way to provide this information is to pass it to the `.kacl.yml` config file

```yaml
kacl:
  git:
    links:
        # The host url is optional and will be automatically determined using your the git repository. If run on gitlab CI the host will be determined by CI_PROJECT_URL if not specified here.
        host_url: https://github.com/mschmieder/kacl-cli
        compare_versions_template: '{host}/compare/v{previous_version}...v{version}'
        unreleased_changes_template: '{host}/tree/v{latest_version}...HEAD'
        initial_version_template: '{host}/tree/v{version}'
```

Using the python format syntax you can generate any links you want. The available replacement variables are `version`, `previous_version`, `host` and `latest_version`.

## Extensions

### Post-release/Hotfix

> **ATTENTION:** this is not SemVer compatible and not part of the KACL standard

In some situations you might come across the challenge to patch a piece of software that is already in production and you _have to_ indicate that this is a `hotfix` release. `SemVer` is not meant to support this other than incrementing the `patch` version of your project, but it is not possible to release `1.0.1-hotfix.1` after `1.0.1` as `-hotfix.1` is considered a `prerelease` version and therefore is lower in order than the `1.0.1` version.

To overcome this, `kacl` provides an `extension` to you can use in such corner cases

You can enable the `post-release` extension by providing the `post_release_version_prefix` within the `extension` secion of your config file. By setting `post_release_version_prefix: hotfix` you can now easily release `hotfix` versions that are considered of higher order than the base version

```yaml
kacl:
  extension:
    post_release_version_prefix: hotfix
```

```bash

# get current version
kacl-cli current
>> 0.3.1

# add another change
kacl-cli add Security "Security Hotfix" -m

# release a hotfix version
kacl-cli release post -m

# get current version
kacl-cli current
>> 0.3.1-hotfix.1
```

## Config file

`kacl-cli` will automatically check if there is a `.kacl.yml` present within your execution directory. Within this configuration file you can set options to improve
specifically CI workflows. It also allows you to better customize the validation behaviour of the system by allowing to define _custom header titles_, _allowed_version_sections_ as well as the
required _default content_.

By specifying a `.kacl.yml` with any of those options, the _default config_ will be merged with those local changes. Most options are also available on the CLI which take precedence over the ones
within the config files.

**Default Config**

```yaml
kacl:
  changelog_file: CHANGELOG.md
  allowed_header_titles:
    - Changelog
    - Change Log
  allowed_version_sections:
    - Added
    - Changed
    - Deprecated
    - Removed
    - Fixed
    - Security
  default_content:
    - All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
    - The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
  git:
    commit: True
    commit_message: "[skip ci] Releasing Changelog version {new_version}"
    commit_additional_files: []
    tag: False
    tag_name: "v{new_version}"
    tag_description: "Version v{new_version} released"
  links:
      # The host url is optional and will be automatically determined using your the git repository
      # host_url: https://github.com/mschmieder/kacl-cli
      compare_versions_template: '{host}/compare/{previous_version}...{version}'
      unreleased_changes_template: '{host}/compare/{latest_version}...master'
      initial_version_template: '{host}/tree/{version}'
      auto_generate: True
  extension:
    post_release_version_prefix: null
```
